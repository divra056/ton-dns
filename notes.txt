In general, an external message begins with                         <--- smc-guidelines.txt
    - a 256-bit signature (if needed), 
    - a 32-bit *req-seqno* (if needed), 
    - a 32-bit *expire-at* (if needed), 
    - and possibly a 32-bit *op* and other required parameters depending on *op*. 
    
The layout of external messages does not need to be as standardized as that of the internal messages because external messages are not used for interaction between different smart contracts (written by different developers and managed by different owners).

Storage:
    - seqno     32 u,
    - pubkey    256 u,
    - root_dict ref,
